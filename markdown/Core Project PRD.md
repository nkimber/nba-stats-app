# NBA Stats Web Application - Complete Project Plan

## Project Overview
Building a containerized full-stack web application to track NBA game statistics with the foundation for future machine learning predictions. This project serves as a learning platform for modern web development practices while working with real basketball data.

## Goals
- **Primary**: Create a complete NBA statistics tracking web application
- **Secondary**: Teach full-stack development using modern tools and containerization
- **Future**: Foundation for ML-based game prediction features

## Target User
Recent Statistics graduate with basic programming experience, familiar with Python and statistical concepts, wanting to learn web development and apply ML techniques to NBA data.

## Technology Stack

### Core Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (containerized)
- **Backend + Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (single container)
- **ORM**: Prisma (for database management)
- **Development**: Docker containers with VS Code Dev Containers
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose orchestration

### Development Environment
- **IDE**: VS Code with Dev Containers extension
- **Runtime**: All development occurs inside Docker containers
- **Host**: Docker Desktop on local laptop
- **Version Control**: GitHub repository

## Container Architecture

### Simple 2-Container Setup
```
├── postgres-container (database tier)
└── nextjs-container (business logic + web UI)
```

### Development Benefits
- **Consistency**: Same environment across different machines
- **Isolation**: No local dependencies beyond VS Code + Docker
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more containers later
- **Learning**: Real containerized development experience

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Teams table
teams (
  id: serial primary key,
  name: varchar (e.g., "Los Angeles Lakers"),
  city: varchar (e.g., "Los Angeles"),
  abbreviation: varchar (e.g., "LAL"),
  conference: varchar (e.g., "Western"),
  division: varchar (e.g., "Pacific")
)

-- Players table
players (
  id: serial primary key,
  name: varchar,
  position: varchar (e.g., "PG", "SG", "SF", "PF", "C"),
  team_id: integer (foreign key to teams),
  jersey_number: integer
)

-- Games table
games (
  id: serial primary key,
  date: date,
  home_team_id: integer (foreign key to teams),
  away_team_id: integer (foreign key to teams),
  home_score: integer,
  away_score: integer,
  season: varchar (e.g., "2023-24"),
  game_type: varchar (e.g., "Regular Season", "Playoffs")
)
```

## Application Features

### Initial "Hello World" Features
1. **Dashboard Page** (`/`)
   - Recent games with scores
   - Team standings summary
   - Basic navigation

2. **Teams Page** (`/teams`)
   - List all NBA teams
   - Win/loss records
   - Conference/division organization

3. **Games Page** (`/games`)
   - Game results with dates
   - Home/away team information
   - Score displays

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/teams` - Return all teams
   - `GET /api/games` - Return game results
   - `GET /api/players` - Return player roster

### Sample Data
- **Teams**: 6-8 popular NBA teams (Lakers, Warriors, Celtics, Heat, etc.)
- **Players**: 3-4 star players per team
- **Games**: 20-30 recent game results with realistic scores
- **Seasons**: Focus on 2023-24 season data

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Hello World)
- Docker containerization
- Basic Next.js app with database connectivity
- Sample NBA data display
- Working API endpoints

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Future)
- More detailed statistics
- Data visualization (charts, graphs)
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Player performance metrics

### Phase 3: ML Integration (Future)
- Historical data analysis
- Game prediction models
- Performance trend analysis
- Statistical insights dashboard
